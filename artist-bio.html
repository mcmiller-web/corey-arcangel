    <p class="bio-paragraph">Cory Arcangel is an American post-conceptual artist, born in 1978 Buffalo, New York and based in Stavanger, Norway, who makes work in various media forms such as drawing, music, video, performance art, and video game modifications using the artistic strategy of appropriation.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="bio-paragraph2">He creatively reuses existing materials to create new works of art, and explores the relationship between pop culture and digital technology as well as the nature of cultural production and consumption within a media and technology-drenched world.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="bio-paragraph3">He is best known for his piece Super Mario Clouds, a video installation he made in which he modified a cartridge of the original Super Mario Brothers, by stripping the game's code to only include the white clouds and blue sky. Cory Arcangel is also known to be the youngest artist since Bruce Nauman to have a full floor solo art show at the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>
