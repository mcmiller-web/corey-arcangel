        <p>This artwork features bowling games reprogrammed to allow only gutter balls via modded controllers. Six generations of game consoles, from the late 1970s to the 2000s, have been modified with original microcontrollers programmed to replay the artist’s input, creating the illusion that the game is “playing itself” through a series of simulations. 14 different ten-pin bowling games, and modified controllers and hacked games were mediums used to craft his piece. This piece highlights the expectation that technology is designed to consistently fulfill our needs, when in reality, despite its evolution, technology often breaks down and becomes obsolete.</p>
        <p>The artwork was part of Arcangel's solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art, titled Pro Tools, referencing the popular audio production software used to creatively manipulate digital audio. The work showcases both the history of video games and the evolution of graphic representation in digital mediums, from pixellated abstraction to realism.</p>
        <p>Since the game is programmed to allow only visual interaction, not physical, the artwork serves as a “wake up call” to reflect on our expectations and dependency on technology to consistently meet our needs and desires. Additionally, Arcangel expresses that this piece acts as a metaphor for our culture's bizarre fascination with technology.</p>
